# Restoring from Kiboruto
The great thing about seed words is that they follow the popular [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) standard. This means that you can use a variety of Bitcoin wallets to recover your funds from this kind of backup. For example, if you lost your mobile phone and bought a new one, you could [download](https://samouraiwallet.com/download) the Samourai Wallet application again and then follow these recovery steps using your Kiboruto to regain access to your bitcoin. 

Once you launch Samourai Wallet, you will have the recommended options to connect to Tor and connect to your own [RoninDojo](https://ronindojo.io/en/tanto). Then you will have the option to restore from backup. Simply enter your seed words in order from your Kiboruto and then add your passphrase from your Kiboruto and then you should be presented with the same PayNym as your original and have access to your bitcoin once again.
