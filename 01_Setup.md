# Setting Up Samourai Wallet

The Kiboruto stainless steel backup was designed specifically for your Samourai Wallet. Stainless steel backups like this can withstand extreme environmental conditions such as a house fire or severe flooding. Often times people will use pen & paper to write down their seed phrase, this is a good start and if you want to use pen & paper then download the Samourai Wallet recovery template [here](https://samouraiwallet.com/recovery/worksheet). Your paper backup may not withstand a house fire or flooding though, consider using both methods to have one as a fail-safe. Keep in mind though that anyone who gains access to this information will technically be able to gain access to your bitcoin, so keep them secure.

Here is a video on how to setup your Samourai Wallet for the first time and get the seed words that you will later stamp into your Kiboruto. Please note that the wallet version (0.99.96g) used in this video has since been updated to a newer version with a detailed explainer introduction. The new version will be showcased later in the guide when demonstrating how to recover your seed words.
