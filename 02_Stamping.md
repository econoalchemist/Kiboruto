# Stamping the Kiboruto

Once you have setup your wallet and identified your PayNym, you can navigate back through the menu to display your seed words and then stamp them into the Kiboruto like shown in the video below. 

1) From your Samourai Wallet home page, navigate to the 3-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner and select `settings` > `wallet` > `show mnemonic`. A dialog box will appear with your 12 seed words. These are the words you want to stamp into the Kiboruto in order. 

2) To test your passphrase prior to stamping, from your Samourai Wallet home page, navigate to the 3-doy menu in the upper right-hand corner and select `settings` > `troubleshoot` > `passphrase/backup test`. From there you can enter you passphrase and Samourai Wallet will confirm if it is correct. Once you know that you have it correct, then you can stamp it in the Kiboruto. 

3) To view your PayNym, from your Samourai Wallet home page, navigate to the blue "+" sign in the lower right-hand corner then select the purple PayNym icon. Your PayNym short name will be displayed directly below your PayNym robot avatar. 

Make sure you use a solid surface to stamp your Kiboruto on, like a concrete floor. A heavy hammer, like a 4-lbs mini sledge works well to get a crisp stamp. You will stamp the 12 seed words in order on the large Kiboruto plate and then stamp your passphrase and PayNym on the small Kiboruto plate. This way you can store the two pieces of information separately if you want. You will need both pieces (seed words + passphrase) to recover your bitcoin in the event you lose access to your wallet.

Now you should have your seed words, unique PayNym, and your passphrase secured in metal on the Kiboruto. This way you have the information needed to restore your Samourai Wallet and recover your Bitcoin in case your phone is lost, damaged, or stolen or your backup is exposed to fire of flooding.

The next section will demonstrate a fire test of the Kiboruto to verify that the backup information is recoverable in the event of extreme environmental conditions.
