# Conclusion
That should be everything you need to restore your Samourai Wallet after a catastrophic event in which you lose your phone and need to restore access to your bitcoin. Should you ever have questions about the wallet derivation path, [WalletsRecovery.org](https://walletsrecovery.org/) has compiled most Bitcoin wallets in a list. Here are the Samourai Wallet derivation paths for example:

- Deposit: m/44'|49'|84'|47'/0'/0'
- Bad Bank: m/84'/0'/2147483644'
- Pre Mix: m/84'/0'/2147483645'
- Post Mix: m/84'/0'/2147483646'
- Ricochet: m/44'|49'|84'/0'/2147483647'

When restoring a Samourai Wallet on another Samourai Wallet client, you will not need to worry about these derivation paths. This would only be cause for consideration if restoring across platforms to another wallet. 

Some final considerations are how many copies of the Kiboruto you want, where to store them, and whether you store the passphrase separately or not. Everyone's threat model, situation, and circumstances are unique so each individual will need to make these decisions on their own. Just keep in mind that an adversary could restore your wallet if they found your seed words and passphrase. 

Using a [RoninDojo](https://ronindojo.io/en/tanto) is the most private way to use Samourai Wallet. [@BitcoinQ_A](https://twitter.com/BitcoinQ_A) wrote a great [guide](https://bitcoiner.guide/ronindojo/) on getting started with it and there are full instructions maintained on the [Ronin Wiki Page](https://wiki.ronindojo.io/en/home). There is also a [Bitcoin Magazine guide](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/set-up-ronindojo-for-private-bitcoin) on setting up the new Plug & Play RoninDojo Tanto.
